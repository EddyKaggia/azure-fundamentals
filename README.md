## ON-PREMISE

- You take all the risk

## CLOUD PREMISES

- Someone else owns the servers

## EVOLUTION OF CLOUD HOSTING

### DEDICATED SERVER

- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- Runs a single web-app/ site
- Very expensive, High Maintenance, \* High Security

### VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER (VPS)

- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines
- Runs multiple web-apps/ sites
- Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources

### SHARED HOSTING

- One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses
- Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources
- Very Cheap, Limited Functionality, Poor Isolation

### CLOUD HOSTING

- Multiple physical machines that act as one system
- The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services
- Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-effective, High Configurability
