# COMMON CLOUD SERVICES

A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:

### COMPUTE

Imagine having a virtual computer that can run an application, programs and code.

### STORAGE

Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.

### NETWORKING

Imagine having the virtual network being able to define internet connections or network isolations.

### DATABASES

Imagine a virtual database for storing and reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application

The term "Cloud Computing" can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has "compute" in the name.

## BENEFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING

- Cost-effective

- Secure

  - Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services can be secure by default or you have teh ability to configure access down to a granular level.

- Reliable

  - Data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication, and fault tolerance.

- Scalable

  - Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand.

- Elastic

  - Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand.

- Current
